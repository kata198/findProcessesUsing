findProcessesUsing
==================

Scans all running applications on a host to identify those using a shared library, or an executable, some other mapping, or an open file descriptor.


This application works on UNIX-derived systems (Linux, BSD, cygwin, etc). You can use it, for example, to scan for processes using a certain version of a shared library, or running under a certain interpreter. It can print a summarized view, or optionally print all matching mappings as well.

This application can also scan for open files, either fully qualified or partially qualified.

This could be paired with  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/remote_copy_and_execute  to do audits of running software/library usage across many machines on a network.


You must be root to scan all running processes, otherwise this will only scan that which is running under your current user.


**Usage**

	Usage: findProcessesUsing (options) [search portion]

	Searches all running processes for those containing a given mapping, or an open file (with \-f).

	Mappings include running executables (like python), or a shared library, or a device.


		Options:

			\-f or \-\-files          Scan for open files instead of mappings. This should not be a symbolic link.


			\-v or \-\-verbose        Also print mapping lines containing the given pattern, or matched filenames when given \-f.

			\-e or \-\-exact          Require exact match. Default is to allow partial matches

			\-p or \-\-pids-only      Only print pids, one per line


			\-i or \-\-ignore-case    Search case-insensitively. By default, case must be an exact match.


			\-\-version              Print the version
			\-h or \-\-help           Display this message and quit



	Examples:

	  findProcessesUsing libpython2.7             # Scan for any processes linking against anything containing "libpython2.7"

	  findProcessesUsing \-f /var/lib/data.db      # Scan for any processes with an open handle to "/var/lib/data.db"



	It is recommended to run this process as root, otherwise you are only able to scan your own processes.



**Example Usage**

Scan for mappings of libc


	]$ sudo findProcessesUsing libc | head -n 20 | tail -n5

	Found libc in 803 (john) [ -bash  ]

	Found libc in 1060 (john) [ /usr/lib/tracker/tracker-extract  ]

	Found libc in 1062 (www) [ /usr/bin/httpd  ]

	Found libc in 808 (frankl) [ /bin/sh /usr/bin/startx  ]

	Found libc in 1065 (frankl) [ /usr/lib/tracker/tracker-miner-user-guides  ]



Scan for open file descriptor of pty


	]$ ./findProcessesUsing -f -v pty

	Found pty {fd=0,1,2,31} in 2384 (user1) [ /bin/bash  ]


				0 = "/dev/pty1"

				1 = "/dev/pty1"

				2 = "/dev/pty1"

				31 = "/dev/pty1"


	Found pty {fd=3} in 5732 (user1) [ SCREEN  ]


				3 = "/dev/pty0"


	Found pty {fd=0,1,2} in 6184 (user1) [ screen  ]


				0 = "/dev/pty0"

				1 = "/dev/pty0"

				2 = "/dev/pty0"


	Found pty {fd=0,1,2} in 5772 (user1) [ python  ]


				0 = "/dev/pty2"

				1 = "/dev/pty2"

				2 = "/dev/pty2"


	Found pty {fd=0,1,2,31} in 6672 (user1) [ -bash  ]


				0 = "/dev/pty0"

				1 = "/dev/pty0"

				2 = "/dev/pty0"

				31 = "/dev/pty0"



	Found pty {fd=0,1,2,31} in 6072 (user1) [ /bin/bash  ]


				0 = "/dev/pty3"

				1 = "/dev/pty3"

				2 = "/dev/pty3"

				31 = "/dev/pty3"



	Found pty {fd=0,1,2,31} in 4796 (user1) [ /bin/bash  ]



				0 = "/dev/pty2"

				1 = "/dev/pty2"

				2 = "/dev/pty2"

				31 = "/dev/pty2"
